\arguments{
\item{Folder}{Path to the folder containing the bin folder with the FContMTT executable. This will also be the folder where the input and the batch files will be saved.}

\item{landscape}{Path to the folder contained the landscape file(s) to be used (either .tif or .lcp)}

\item{CrownFireMethod}{Numerical. Either 0 for the Finney's method, or 1 for use of Scott and Rheinhardt's method.}

\item{customfmd}{File containing the characterization of custom fuel models (.fmd file).}

\item{FmsFolder}{Path to the folder containing the fms file(s) to be use in the simulation.}

\item{Resolution}{Numeric. Represents the desired resolution of calculations.}

\item{GridDistanceUnits}{Numeric. Sets grid distance units, where 0 is for meters and 1 is for feet.}

\item{wind.speed}{Numeric. Value of the wind speed to be used in the FConstMTT runs.}

\item{wind.direction}{Numeric. Value of the wind direction to be used in the FConstMTT runs.}

\item{Duration.1}{Vector of values that define the interval of duration values to be tested in the first duration class. The vector must contain three values: c(from, to, by).}

\item{Duration.2}{Optional. vector of values that define the interval of duration values to be tested in the second duration class. The vector must contain three values: c(from, to, by).}

\item{Duration.3}{Optional. vector of values that define the interval of duration values to be tested in the third duration class. The vector must contain three values: c(from, to, by).}

\item{Duration.4}{Optional. vector of values that define the interval of duration values to be tested in the fourth duration class. The vector must contain three values: c(from, to, by).}

\item{Duration.5}{Optional. vector of values that define the interval of duration values to be tested in the fifth duration class. The vector must contain three values: c(from, to, by).}

\item{Duration.1.weight}{Numeric. Describes the relative frequency of the fire size classes that are represented by the duration class 1.}

\item{Duration.2.weight}{Numeric. Describes the relative frequency of the fire size classes that are represented by the duration class 2.}

\item{Duration.3.weight}{Numeric. Describes the relative frequency of the fire size classes that are represented by the duration class 3.}

\item{Duration.4.weight}{Numeric. Describes the relative frequency of the fire size classes that are represented by the duration class 4.}

\item{Duration.5.weight}{Numeric. Describes the relative frequency of the fire size classes that are represented by the duration class 5.}

\item{WS_unit}{Either kmh or mph.}

\item{FireListFile}{Path to the folder containing the ignitions to be used.}

\item{SpotProbability}{Numerical. Value to be used in the spot probability during the FConstMTT simulations.}

\item{output.folder}{Path to the folder where the outputs should be saved.}

\item{OutputFirePerims}{Binary. If 1, then the simulated fire perimeters are stored. If 0, then the simulated fire perimeters are not stored.}

\item{MetricFLP}{If 1, then the outputs of flame length probability (FLP file) are stored in meters. If 0, then the FLP files are stored in feet.}

\item{Run.fconstmtt}{Binary. If 1, then FConstMTT will automatically start running after creating the required files. If 0, then the .input and batch files are created but FConstMTT does not start running.}
}
\value{
Returns the input and batch files required to run FConstMTT for all the combinations to be tested. Optionally, FConstMTT might be run from R after the creation of the required files.
}
\description{
Uses the files generated by the functions build_report and Gen_ign to generate the input and batch files and to run FConstMTT. Uses a single meteorological scenario (i.e. only one value for wind direction and wind speed)
