MTT fire spread semi-automatic calibration - R package

This R package is meant to assists in the calibration of the [MTT](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/x02-068) fire spread models.

## File Descriptions
- Gen_ign.R is the script that generates ignitions in the study area that either follow a surface of probability of ignition (raster file) or are randomly allocated
- build_report.R is the script that creates files with meteorological characterization of the study area during fire events (csv and fms files); and a word file with the characterization of the fire regime.
- check_BP_nxburned.R
- check_fire_size.R
- fire_weather_nc.R
- get_fire_weather.R
- run_fconstmtt.R is the script that uses the files generated by the functions build_report and Gen_ign to generate the input and batch files. Optionally, it runs FConstMTT.
